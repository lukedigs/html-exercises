# HTML Drill #2 - Favorite Things!

In this exercise, write a complete HTML page using elements discussed in the lecture, as well as from the readings.

Make the page about your favorite things! Don't worry about images yet, unless you understand how to implement them properly.

Don't forget the basics: `doctype`, `html`, `head`, and `body`.

Practice structuring your page by using the following elements:

- `header`, `article`, `section`, `aside`, `footer`
- Meaningful heading tags and levels (& headings too!)
- Common content block elements: `p` and lists, such as `ul` or `ol` with nested list items (`li`)
- Inline elements, such as `a`, `strong`, and `em`, where you deem appropriate.
- Any HTML element attributes for particular elements, e.g., `a` elements should at least use the `href` attribute. Or, `meta` elements in the head have multiple attributes to practice.

Finally, be sure to pay attention to the devilish details: 

- Opening and closing tags, and 
- Representing what level an element is in the tree hierarchy. 

Recall how you will represent hierarchy through your indentation scheme, and how we all set our code editors to use a *2-space indentation* rule. Here's a basic example below to help you remember:

```
<!doctype html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <h1>Example indentation</h1>
    </header>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Project Folder Setup

Within the root of this folder, `2-fave-things`, create the following within VSC like we practiced during class:

- A new folder with your lastname
- Inside this folder, create a new `index.html` file. 

## Tips and Suggestions

Please commit and push your code as you progress to our repo. That means, if you finish a section, or need to pause your work, save it, commit it, and push it to Github. That way, your work is saved in 2 locations too!

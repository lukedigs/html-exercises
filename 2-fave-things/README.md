# HTML Drill #2 - Favorite Things!

In this exercise, write a complete HTML page using elements discussed in the lecture, as well as from the readings.

Make the page about your favorite things! Don't worry about images yet, unless you understand how to implement them properly.

## Project Folder Setup

Within the root of this folder, `2-fave-things`, create the following within VSC like we practiced during class:

- A new folder with your lastname
- Inside this folder, create a new `index.html` file. 

## Reminders

Don't forget the basics: doctype, html, head, and body.

Please commit and push your code as you progress to our repo. That means, if you finish a section, or need to pause your work, save it, commit it, and push it to Github. That way, your work is saved in 2 locations too!
